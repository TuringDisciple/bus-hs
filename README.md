### Introduction
BUS is a fully functional parser combinator library written in a Ocaml. It exists not to replace current parser libraries, but rather to act as a toy parser library for the curious and learning. Relatively small, bus uses advanced concepts in functional programming, which are easily accessible to a learner of functional languages who may not know these concepts, or may want to see these concepts in action.

### How does it work?
The best way to illustrate how this library works is via an example. Suppose that I define a simple language as such which describes a simple language consisting of expressions which can be added, and subtracted.

      <expr>  := ("+"|"-") <term> ( ("+"|"-") <term> )*
      <term>  := ("0"|"1"|"2"|"3"|"4"|"5"|"6"|"7"|"8"|"9")+

For those not familiar with [Backus-Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form), this is a way of representing context-free grammars. ***<expr>*** terms are made of one ***<term>*** or strings of ***<term>*** separated by plus and minus terms. Each ***<num>*** term is simply a string of one or more digits.
So for example ***"1", "-1+2", "42-32"*** are all strings within the grammar but strings such as ***100++, --5, 2-4+*** are not.

So what would a parser for this language look like? Well first we would define a data structure that corresponds to our grammars description. This may seem pointless as we could just parse the input on the fly, but it makes our lives easier as will be seen.

      type parity  = Pos | Neg
      type term    = Term of int
      type expr_op = Add of term | Minus of term
      type expr    = Expr of parity * term * expr_op list

Then using our parser combinators we can map input strings to these constructors. For
example to construct the parity type for expr terms we have the following parser combinator for parity.

      let parity_p : parity parser=
          ( Pos <$ ( char_s "+"  ) ) <|> ( Neg <$ ( char_s "-" ) )
      <|> pure Pos

And the following combinators for the remaining constructors.

      let term_p : term parser = ( fun x -> Term x ) <$> number

      let expr_op_p : expr_op parser =
         ( ( fun t -> Add t )   <$ char_s "+" <*> term_p )
      <|>( ( fun t -> Minus t ) <$ char_s "-" <*> term_p )

      let expr_p : expr parser =
         ( fun p t eop -> Expr (p, t, eop) ) <$> parity_p <*> term_p <*> many expr_op_p

Example usage of these combinators can be seen

      parse "+123-45" expr_p;;
